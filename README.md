After completing [the course on Udemy](https://github.com/chasowska/course-CSS), I tackled the
creation of a form. To challenge myself, I
found
a design on Dribbble (link attached below) and decided to make the page responsive for various
screen sizes for the first time. After the course, where I mainly followed the instructor's
guidance, I can finally start creating pages independently.

The task for the challenge, as before, was taken
from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/html-and-css-code-challenges-for-beginners/).
It reads as follows:

### Create a survey form

HTML forms are important parts of many websites. Create a form for a survey on the topic of your
choice. It should include:

- A variety of answer options
- Text fields
- Dropdowns
- Radio buttons
- Checkboxes
- A submit button

Donâ€™t forget to add a title, and consider using CSS to improve the look of your
form.

### My personal tasks

1. Make the page responsive for various screen sizes.
2. Learn to custom style inputs, radio buttons, and checkboxes.
3. Add "*" to required fields.
4. Add validation for "email" and "phone" fields.

The new knowledge gained from the course proved to be very useful, although I still referred to the
course materials and search engine many times during the form development. This time, the
development process was noticeably faster for me, indicating that I am gradually mastering the
acquired knowledge.
